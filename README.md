# Challenge-Horiseon
# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Horiseon needed help to refactor an existing webpage. The basic structure of the page was solid and functioned okay however with my help we are able to make some slight changes to the HTML and make it even better without changing any of the functions of the page. I've added "alt" tags to all the images that should have them as well as implemented semantic code to help the flow of information that could be digested a bit easier. I did this by removing most "div" that could be identified another way. Examples of this would be detinguishing header and footer.
